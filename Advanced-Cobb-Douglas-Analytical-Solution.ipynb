    "## Background: Maximum Utility Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
    "Suppose you have a collection of risky assets in portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$.\n",
    "The goal is to allocate a fixed budget $B$ across these assets to __maximize the utility__ of the portfolio, where the utility is directly informed by quantitative investor preferences measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Utility Function:__ A utility function $U:\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{P}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ maps the number of shares of each asset in the portfolio to a real-valued utility score that reflects the investor's satisfaction with that allocation. We use a Cobb-Douglas utility function to model investor preferences:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "U\\left(n_{1},n_{2},\\dots,n_{P}\\right) = \\kappa(\\gamma)\\prod_{i\\in\\mathcal{P}}n_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "> where $\\gamma_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is the __preference coefficient__ for asset $i$ (we need to estimate these values), and $\\kappa(\\gamma)$ is a leading coefficient that sets the scale of the utility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n_{i}\\in\\left(n_{1},\\dots,n_{P}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)^{\\top}$ be the __number of shares__ of asset $i$ in the portfolio (we need to estimate these values). \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Inclusion:__ Not every asset is included in the __final__ portfolio from the universe of possible assets; inclusion (or exclusion) of an asset is governed by the __binary action vector__ $\\mathbf{a}_{j}$ specified by a bandit agent, where $a_{j} = 1$ if asset $j$ is included in the portfolio,  and $a_{j} = 0$ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "An investment budget $B$ is allocated across the assets in the portfolio, where $p_{i}$ is the acquisition price of asset $i$ at the time of allocation. The optimal portfolio is the solution\n",
    "of the utility maximization problem:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\underset{n_{1},\\dots,n_{P}}{\\text{maximize}} &\\quad \\kappa(\\gamma)\\prod_{i\\in\\mathcal{P}}n_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}} \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{subject to}&\\quad B =  \\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{P}}n_{i}\\;{p}_{i}\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "In this analysis, we assume that the budget $B$ is fixed during a time period, \n",
    "and that the prices $p_{i}$ are fixed at the time of allocation (and are bounded by the bid-ask spread), and we allow fractional shares of assets. \n",
    "Short selling is not allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The leading coefficient $\\kappa(\\gamma)$ sets the scale of the utility function. \n",
    "However, given that the utility is ordinal, we can set the scale of the utility function to an arbitrary value, \n",
    "e.g., $\\kappa \\pm {1}$, where $\\kappa = 1$ if all the $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients are positive, \n",
    "and $\\kappa = -1$ if $\\textit{any}$ of the $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients are negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Solution\n",
    "The share optimization problem has an __analytical solution__. \n",
    "Let $S = \\left\\{i\\mid\\mathbf{a} = 1\\right\\}$ be the set of assets in the portfolio; $S_{+} = \\left\\{i\\mid\\gamma_{i}>0\\right\\}$ be the set of preferred assets, $S_{-} = \\left\\{i\\mid\\gamma_{i}<0\\right\\}$ be the set of non-preferred assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Practicum Note:__ In the practicum notebook, we establish which assets to include in the portfolio directly based upon the investor preference coefficients $\\gamma_{i}$, i.e., we set $a_{i} = 1$ if $\\gamma_{i}>0$, and $a_{i} = 0$ otherwise. Thus, in the practicum notebook, we have that $S = S_{+}$. We do not invest in assets with negative preference coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the optimal maximum utility portfolio given the action $\\mathbf{a}$, the budget $B$, user preferences $\\gamma_{i}$, \n",
    "and the acquisition share price $p_{i}$ of asset $i$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Investor Preference Model\n",
    "The $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients reflect the relative importance of each asset in generating utility for the investor. These coefficients can incorporate market conditions, sentiment, and other asset-specific information through an $m$-dimensional feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$:\n",

    "where $\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is an activation function such that $\\sigma_{\\theta}(x)\\in[-1,1]$,\n",
    "and $\\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p}$ denotes the feature weights that can be learned from data or set based on subjective beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've proposed a model for the investor preference coefficients $\\gamma_{i}$ that combines both bandit agent preferences and market fundamentals in the practicum notebook.\n",
